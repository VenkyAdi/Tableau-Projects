Welcome to the repository for the Supply Chain Analysis project for a Steel Tube Manufacturing Industry. This project leverages Tableau to visualize and analyze the supply chain, aiming to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve decision-making processes.

## Overview
Supply chain management is crucial for the steel tube manufacturing industry due to the complexity of raw material procurement, production processes, and distribution channels. This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the supply chain, identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement.

## Objectives
- **Optimize Inventory Levels**: Ensure the right amount of raw materials and finished products are available to meet demand without overstocking.
- **Improve Supplier Performance**: Assess and compare supplier performance to ensure quality and timely deliveries.
- **Enhance Production Efficiency**: Monitor production metrics to minimize downtime and improve throughput.
- **Streamline Distribution**: Analyze transportation and distribution channels to reduce costs and delivery times.

## Data Sources
The analysis is based on data collected from various points within the supply chain, including:
- **Raw Material Procurement**: Data on raw material orders, deliveries, and lead times.
- **Production Data**: Information on production volumes, cycle times, and machine utilization.
- **Inventory Levels**: Stock levels of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods.
- **Sales and Distribution**: Data on sales orders, delivery times, and transportation costs.

## Key Metrics
The key metrics analyzed in this project include:
- **Lead Time**: Time taken from placing an order to receiving the raw materials.
- **Inventory Turnover**: Rate at which inventory is used and replaced.
- **Production Cycle Time**: Time taken to manufacture steel tubes from raw materials.
- **Order Fulfillment Time**: Time taken to deliver finished products to customers.
- **Supplier Reliability**: Consistency and reliability of suppliers in meeting order requirements.

## Tableau Dashboards
The Tableau dashboards provide interactive visualizations for a deep dive into the supply chain performance. The dashboards include:
- **Inventory Management Dashboard**: Tracks inventory levels and turnover rates.
- **Supplier Performance Dashboard**: Compares the performance of different suppliers based on delivery times and quality.
- **Production Efficiency Dashboard**: Monitors production cycle times and machine utilization rates.
- **Distribution Analysis Dashboard**: Analyzes transportation costs and delivery times to optimize distribution.

## Usage
To access the Tableau dashboards:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/steel-tube-supply-chain-analysis.git`
2. Open the Tableau workbooks located in the `tableau/` directory.
3. Connect to your data sources or use the sample data provided.
4. Explore the interactive dashboards to gain insights into the supply chain.
